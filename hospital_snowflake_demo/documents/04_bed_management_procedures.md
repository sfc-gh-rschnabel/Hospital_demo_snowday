# Bed Management Procedures

## Document Information
- **Policy Number**: BED-001
- **Effective Date**: January 1, 2024
- **Review Date**: January 1, 2025
- **Department**: Bed Management / Patient Flow
- **Approved By**: Dr. Amanda Rodriguez, VP of Operations

## Purpose
To optimize patient flow, maximize bed utilization, and ensure appropriate bed placement for all admitted patients while maintaining quality and safety standards.

## Bed Utilization Targets

### Occupancy Rate Guidelines
| Status | Occupancy Rate | Action |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Green | 70-80% | Normal operations |
| Yellow | 80-85% | Enhanced monitoring |
| Orange | 85-92% | Capacity alert |
| Red | > 92% | Surge protocols activated |

**Target Range**: 85-92% occupancy (Queensland Health standard)

## Bed Types and Allocation

### Bed Categories
1. **ICU/CCU Beds**: Critical care, 1:1 or 1:2 nursing
2. **Step-Down/Telemetry**: Intermediate care, cardiac monitoring
3. **Medical/Surgical**: General acute care
4. **Observation**: Short-stay (< 48 hours expected)
5. **Isolation**: Negative pressure, contact precautions
6. **Pediatric**: Age-appropriate environment
7. **Private/Semi-Private**: Patient preference and clinical need

### Daily Rate Structure
| Bed Type | Daily Rate | Equipment Included |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| ICU | $2,500-3,500 | Full monitoring, ventilator capability |
| Step-Down | $1,500-2,000 | Telemetry monitoring |
| Private | $800-1,200 | Single occupancy, TV, private bathroom |
| Semi-Private | $500-800 | Shared room, curtain divider |
| Standard | $400-600 | Basic accommodation |
| Isolation | $1,000-1,500 | Negative pressure, anteroom |

## Bed Assignment Process

### Priority Levels
1. **Priority 1 - Critical**: ICU transfers, ED critical admits, post-operative
2. **Priority 2 - Urgent**: ED admits awaiting > 2 hours, step-down needs
3. **Priority 3 - Routine**: Elective admissions, direct admits
4. **Priority 4 - Flexible**: Observation, patient preference changes

### Assignment Criteria
Beds assigned based on:
1. Clinical acuity and care requirements
2. Isolation/infection control needs
3. Monitoring requirements (telemetry, ICU)
4. Gender-appropriate placement
5. Proximity to nursing station (fall risk)
6. Equipment needs (bariatric, specialty)
7. Unit specialization (cardiac, neuro, oncology)

## Real-Time Bed Tracking

### Bed Status Categories
- **Available**: Clean, ready for patient
- **Occupied**: Patient currently in bed
- **Pending Discharge**: Discharge order written, awaiting departure
- **Cleaning**: EVS in process
- **Maintenance**: Out of service for repairs
- **Blocked**: Held for specific patient or unit need

### Status Updates Required
| Event | Update By | Timeframe |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Patient Arrival | Unit RN | Within 15 minutes |
| Discharge Order | Unit Secretary | Immediately |
| Patient Departure | Unit RN | Within 15 minutes |
| Bed Clean Complete | EVS | Within 15 minutes |
| Maintenance Complete | Facilities | Same day |

## Bed Meetings and Huddles

### Daily Bed Huddles
**Time**: 7:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM, 7:00 PM
**Participants**: Bed Management, Charge Nurses, House Supervisor, Case Management

**Agenda**:
1. Current census and occupancy
2. Pending discharges by unit
3. Pending admissions (ED, OR, direct)
4. Potential barriers to discharge
5. Overflow/diversion status

### Weekly Capacity Meeting
**Time**: Monday 10:00 AM
**Participants**: Operations leadership, Bed Management, OR Scheduling, Case Management

**Topics**:
1. Week-ahead surgical schedule
2. Expected admission volume
3. Staffing projections
4. Maintenance/construction impacts

## Surge Capacity Protocols

### Level 1 Surge (85-90% occupancy)
- Cancel elective surgeries requiring overnight stay
- Accelerate discharge rounds
- Consider observation-to-outpatient conversions
- Double occupancy for appropriate semi-private rooms

### Level 2 Surge (90-95% occupancy)
- Activate overflow units
- Implement early discharge protocols
- House Supervisor assumes bed coordination
- Consider ED ambulance diversion

### Level 3 Surge (> 95% occupancy)
- Administrator notification required
- Hallway beds in monitored areas (temporary)
- Mutual aid with nearby facilities
- Formal ambulance diversion activated

## Discharge by Noon Initiative

### Target
70% of discharges completed by 12:00 PM

### Strategies
1. Previous-day discharge planning
2. Physician rounds complete by 10:00 AM
3. Pharmacy discharge meds ready by 9:00 AM
4. Transportation pre-arranged
5. Patient education completed day before
6. Morning discharge incentive tracking

## Key Performance Indicators

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Average Occupancy Rate | 85-92% | Daily |
| Occupied Bed Days (OBD) | Varies | Monthly |
| Available Bed Days (ABD) | Varies | Monthly |
| Bed Turnaround Time | < 60 minutes | Per discharge |
| ED Boarding Time | < 2 hours | Per patient |
| Discharge Before Noon | ≥ 70% | Daily |
| ALOS (Avg Length of Stay) | Per DRG benchmark | Monthly |
