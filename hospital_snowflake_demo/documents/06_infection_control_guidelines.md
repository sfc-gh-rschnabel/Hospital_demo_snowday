# Infection Control Guidelines

## Document Information
- **Policy Number**: IC-001
- **Effective Date**: January 1, 2024
- **Review Date**: January 1, 2025
- **Department**: Infection Prevention and Control
- **Approved By**: Dr. Lisa Wang, Chief Infection Control Officer

## Purpose
To prevent the transmission of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) through evidence-based practices, surveillance, and education for all healthcare workers and patients.

## Standard Precautions

Standard precautions apply to ALL patient care regardless of diagnosis:

### Hand Hygiene
**The Five Moments for Hand Hygiene (WHO)**:
1. Before touching a patient
2. Before clean/aseptic procedure
3. After body fluid exposure risk
4. After touching a patient
5. After touching patient surroundings

**Hand Hygiene Methods**:
- Alcohol-based hand rub: 20 seconds minimum
- Soap and water: 40-60 seconds (preferred when visibly soiled)
- Before and after glove use

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

| PPE Item | When Required |
|----------|--------------|
| Gloves | Contact with blood, body fluids, mucous membranes, non-intact skin |
| Gown | Procedures likely to generate splashes; contact precautions |
| Surgical Mask | Within 6 feet of coughing patient; droplet precautions |
| N95 Respirator | Airborne precautions; aerosol-generating procedures |
| Eye Protection | Splashes anticipated; COVID-19 suspected cases |
| Face Shield | High splash risk; aerosol-generating procedures |

### Safe Injection Practices
- Use single-dose vials when possible
- Never reuse needles or syringes
- Use aseptic technique for all injections
- Dispose sharps immediately in approved containers

## Transmission-Based Precautions

### Contact Precautions
**Indications**: MRSA, VRE, C. difficile, scabies, draining wounds

**Requirements**:
- Private room preferred (or cohorting)
- Gown and gloves for all room entry
- Dedicated patient care equipment
- Enhanced environmental cleaning
- Contact Precautions signage

### Droplet Precautions
**Indications**: Influenza, RSV, pertussis, meningococcal disease, mumps

**Requirements**:
- Private room (door may remain open)
- Surgical mask within 6 feet of patient
- Patient wears mask during transport
- Droplet Precautions signage

### Airborne Precautions
**Indications**: Tuberculosis, measles, varicella, COVID-19 (aerosolizing procedures)

**Requirements**:
- Negative pressure airborne infection isolation room (AIIR)
- N95 respirator for all room entry
- Door must remain closed
- Patient wears mask if leaving room
- Airborne Precautions signage
- Fit testing documentation current

## Specific Pathogen Protocols

### Clostridioides difficile (C. diff)
- Contact precautions
- Soap and water hand washing (alcohol ineffective against spores)
- Terminal cleaning with sporicidal agent
- Single-use equipment when possible
- Antimicrobial stewardship consultation

### Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
- Contact precautions for active infection
- Screening per unit protocol
- Decolonization for surgical patients
- Enhanced environmental cleaning
- Cohorting when rooms unavailable

### COVID-19
- Airborne plus Contact precautions
- N95 respirator and eye protection
- Negative pressure room preferred
- Enhanced PPE for aerosol-generating procedures
- Visitor restrictions per current policy

### Tuberculosis (TB)
- Airborne precautions
- Negative pressure room required
- N95 respirator mandatory
- Door must remain closed
- Serial negative AFB smears x3 for discontinuation

## Environmental Cleaning

### Daily Cleaning
- High-touch surfaces cleaned every shift
- Patient room cleaned daily
- Bathroom cleaned daily
- Equipment wiped between patients

### Terminal Cleaning
Required upon patient discharge for:
- All isolation rooms
- C. difficile cases (sporicidal agent)
- Multi-drug resistant organism cases
- COVID-19 cases
- Any room with visible contamination

### High-Touch Surfaces
Priority cleaning areas:
- Bed rails and call buttons
- IV pumps and poles
- Door handles
- Light switches
- Bathroom fixtures
- Bedside tables
- Chair arms

## Surveillance and Reporting

### Reportable Conditions
Immediately report to Infection Prevention:
- Clusters of similar infections
- Multi-drug resistant organisms
- Healthcare-associated infections
- Outbreaks (2+ linked cases)
- Novel or unusual pathogens

### Surveillance Metrics
| Metric | Target | Reporting |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Central Line-Associated BSI (CLABSI) | 0 | Monthly |
| Catheter-Associated UTI (CAUTI) | 0 | Monthly |
| Surgical Site Infection (SSI) | Below national benchmark | Monthly |
| C. difficile Rate | Below national benchmark | Monthly |
| Hand Hygiene Compliance | > 90% | Monthly |

## Healthcare Worker Exposure

### Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure
1. Immediately wash affected area
2. Report to supervisor
3. Complete exposure report
4. Report to Employee Health or ED (after hours)
5. Source patient testing initiated
6. Post-exposure prophylaxis as indicated

### Respiratory Exposure
1. Report unprotected exposure to Infection Prevention
2. TB exposure: Baseline and 8-12 week testing
3. COVID-19 exposure: Follow current protocol
4. Varicella exposure: Check immunity, consider post-exposure prophylaxis

## Outbreak Management

### Outbreak Response Steps
1. Recognize cluster or unusual pattern
2. Notify Infection Prevention immediately
3. Implement enhanced precautions
4. Case finding and line listing
5. Environmental assessment
6. Laboratory testing
7. Control measures implementation
8. Communication plan activation
9. Post-outbreak review

## Staff Education and Competency

### Required Training
- Annual infection control education
- Hand hygiene competency
- PPE donning/doffing competency
- N95 fit testing (annual)
- Blood/body fluid exposure response

### Competency Documentation
- New hire orientation
- Annual competency verification
- Post-exposure retraining as needed
- Unit-specific protocols
