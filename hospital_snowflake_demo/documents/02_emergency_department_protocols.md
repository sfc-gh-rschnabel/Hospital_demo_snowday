## Document Information
- **Policy Number**: ED-001
- **Effective Date**: January 1, 2024
- **Review Date**: January 1, 2025
- **Department**: Emergency Medicine
- **Approved By**: Dr. Michael Torres, ED Medical Director

## Purpose
To establish standardized protocols for the efficient and safe management of patients presenting to the Emergency Department, ensuring timely assessment, treatment, and disposition.

## Triage Protocol

### ESI (Emergency Severity Index) Levels

| Level | Description | Target Time to Provider | Examples |
|-------|-------------|-------------------------|----------|
| ESI 1 | Resuscitation | Immediate | Cardiac arrest, severe trauma, respiratory failure |
| ESI 2 | Emergent | < 10 minutes | Chest pain, stroke symptoms, severe allergic reaction |
| ESI 3 | Urgent | < 30 minutes | Abdominal pain, fractures, moderate illness |
| ESI 4 | Less Urgent | < 60 minutes | Minor lacerations, sprains, UTI symptoms |
| ESI 5 | Non-Urgent | < 120 minutes | Prescription refills, minor complaints |

### Triage Assessment Requirements
1. Chief complaint documented
2. Vital signs (BP, HR, RR, Temp, SpO2, Pain score)
3. Brief history and physical assessment
4. Allergy verification
5. Current medications documented
6. ESI level assigned and documented

## NEAT (National Emergency Access Target) Compliance

### 4-Hour Target
- **Target**: 90% of ED patients seen, treated, and discharged or admitted within 4 hours
- **Clock starts**: Time of ED registration
- **Clock stops**: Time of physical departure from ED

### Strategies for NEAT Compliance
1. Rapid triage and assessment
2. Early senior physician involvement for ESI 1-2
3. Parallel processing of diagnostics
4. Bed Management notification at decision-to-admit
5. Fast-track pathway for ESI 4-5 patients
6. Results follow-up by designated staff

## Clinical Pathways

### Chest Pain Pathway
1. Immediate ECG (within 10 minutes of arrival)
2. Troponin and basic metabolic panel
3. Aspirin 324mg (if not contraindicated)
4. Cardiology consult for STEMI activation
5. Risk stratification using HEART score

### Stroke Pathway
1. CODE STROKE activation for suspected CVA
2. Non-contrast CT head within 25 minutes
3. Neurology notification
4. tPA consideration if within window
5. NIH Stroke Scale assessment

### Sepsis Pathway
1. Sepsis screening for at-risk patients
2. Blood cultures x 2 before antibiotics
3. Lactate level
4. Broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour
5. Fluid resuscitation (30 mL/kg crystalloid)
6. ICU consultation for severe sepsis

### Trauma Pathway
1. Trauma team activation per criteria
2. Primary survey (ABCDE)
3. FAST ultrasound
4. Secondary survey
5. CT imaging as indicated
6. Surgical consultation for operative injuries

## Admission Process from ED

### Decision to Admit
1. Admitting physician contacted
2. Admission orders entered
3. Bed request submitted to Bed Management
4. Patient registration updated to inpatient
5. Report given to receiving unit

### Boarding Patients
When inpatient beds are unavailable:
- Continue ED-level monitoring and care
- Update orders to reflect inpatient status
- Nursing handoff communication completed
- Maximum boarding time target: 2 hours

## Discharge Process

### Safe Discharge Requirements
1. Vital signs stable (within normal limits or baseline)
2. Discharge instructions provided and understood
3. Prescriptions reviewed with patient
4. Follow-up appointment scheduled or instructions given
5. Transportation arranged if needed
6. Patient signature on discharge documentation

### High-Risk Discharge Follow-up
Patients requiring 24-48 hour callback:
- Chest pain with negative workup
- Abdominal pain of unclear etiology
- Falls in elderly patients
- Pediatric fever
- Mental health evaluations

## Medication Management in ED

### High-Alert Medications
Additional verification required for:
- Opioids
- Anticoagulants
- Insulin
- Paralytics
- Sedatives

### Pain Management Protocol
1. Pain assessment (1-10 scale) at triage
2. Re-assessment every 30 minutes until controlled
3. Non-opioid first-line when appropriate
4. Opioid risk assessment for prescriptions
5. Narcan education for opioid prescriptions

## Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| NEAT Compliance | ≥ 90% | Monthly |
| Left Without Being Seen (LWBS) | < 2% | Monthly |
| Door-to-ECG Time | < 10 minutes | Weekly |
| Door-to-Needle (tPA) | < 60 minutes | Per case |
| Sepsis Bundle Compliance | ≥ 85% | Monthly |
| Patient Satisfaction | ≥ 80% | Quarterly |

## Staffing Requirements

### Minimum Staffing Ratios
- ESI 1-2 patients: 1:1 or 1:2 nursing ratio
- ESI 3 patients: 1:3 nursing ratio
- ESI 4-5 patients: 1:4 nursing ratio

### Physician Coverage
- 24/7 emergency physician coverage
- On-call specialists available within 30 minutes
- Trauma surgeon available for Level II activation
